                            <p>A wonderfull place, yet so much sadness. This was a life-changing trip. The people of Mali have almost nothing yet they are warm, sincere and honest.</p>

                            <p>Mali is an old french colony and it shows when you talk with the Malians, their french is very good. Another fact that amazed me was that they always smile. We visited the country in January of 2008, so winter for them, yet so hot for us. The average temperature was about 30 to 35C, yet the Malians where are wearing long sleeved shirts, we were not...</p>
                            <p>War came back to Mali in the recent years, but I recently it seamed to have calmed down a lot. I hope that when peace comes to Mali it stays there for a while. </p>

                            <p>There is too much to say about Taiwan. It is beautiful, modern, fun and most of all a true melting-pot of asia's traditions. This is where bubble tea was invented. If you don't know what it is then you're missing out on a fun treat. The island to Taiwan is small yet that is not a problem. That simply means you'll travel shorter distance to go to awesome place like Kending, Toroko gorges and Jade mountain.</p>
                            <p>To show how much I liked Taiwan: I went twice. The sights wont disapoint you but the food will really impress you. </p>

                            <p>I went to Shanghai twice for a work project. My weeks where full but I made the best of my weekends. First thing to know: Shanghai is busy. Do not go there if you expect peace and quiet. There are other parts of China for that. The bustling city might be intimidating at first but many foreigners call it home and really love it. For food: anything you can posibly imagine and more. I had the best Turkish meal of my life in Shanghai. There are great places also to make custom suits or dresses, you'd be surprised at what they can do and for what price.</p>

                               <p>The CSS will reference the pictures (they are background image, not a thumbnail) and style them accordingly. The pictures should be big enough so as not to be repeated.</p>
                        
                           </div>
                       </div>
                   </div>
                    <section id="nova" data-type="background" data-speed="5">
                        
                    </section>
                     <div class="jumbotron">
                        <h1>So that is what it looks like</h1>
                        <p>Obviously this is a test run. I took the pictures from the hubble telescope website. Any images big enough will do but you have to take into account the scrolling effect will not center the image exactly like you expect. Hope you like it.</p>
